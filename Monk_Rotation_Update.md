# Windwalker Monk Rotation Update

I've updated the Monk rotations in the RotationMaster addon with optimized rotations for Mists of Pandaria Classic.

## Windwalker Monk Updates

### Single Target Rotation
- Added proper priority-based rotation with Chi management
- Added Tigereye Brew usage (primary damage cooldown, use at 10 stacks)
- Added Energizing Brew for energy regeneration
- Improved sequence for higher damage output
- Fixed incorrect spell ordering

### AoE Rotation
- Improved for 3+ targets
- Optimized spell priority order
- Added proper Chi management

### New Rotations Added
- Opener Sequence - Optimized for the start of boss fights

## Brewmaster Monk Updates

### Expanded from a single rotation to multiple specialized rotations:
- Defensive rotation - Focused on survival and mitigation
- Offensive rotation - Threat generation
- AoE tanking rotation - Multiple target threat management
- Utility rotation - Movement and crowd control abilities
- Cooldowns - Defensive and emergency abilities

## Mistweaver Monk Updates

### Expanded to provide better healing options:
- Single Target rotation - Focused on tank and priority target healing
- AoE healing rotation - For raid and group healing
- Fistweaving rotation - Damage-focused healing through Eminence
- Cooldowns - Emergency healing and defensive abilities

## Notes on Usage
- For Windwalker, maintain proper Chi (3-4) for key abilities
- Use Tigereye Brew at 10 stacks for maximum damage
- For Brewmaster, cycle between defensive and offensive rotations as needed
- For Mistweaver, switch between direct healing and fistweaving based on situation

All rotations include detailed comments explaining each spell's purpose.
